**project is abandoned**  
It was nice and fun and I'm really happy with few features that I've managed to get here but for what I need I've created completely new project that I'm happily using for a few years already. If interested have a look at [new repo]( https://github.com/yanhamu/Badzeet) or go straight to [demo]( https://badzeet.azurewebsites.net)

I'm leaving the rest of README here for nostalgia

Personal finance manager web application

- intended to run on home network (RaspPi)

# Main goals - features
- integration with real bank account (extensible enough to implement your own bank account provider), with automatic synchronization
- predefined reports + very customizable reports to manage expenses and do budgeting
- daily / weekly / monthly custom email reporting (no need to interact with application)
